# Traveling_Salesman_Problem_via_Evolutionary_Algorithm
Finding the shortest path and solving the traveling salesman problem using evolutionary algorithm

### Aside from traditional path-finding algorithms such as A* search, greedy search, depth-first search... This project applies using evolutionary algorithms with genetic crossovers and mutation to find the shortest path with iterations.
